    <p class="space" style="text-align: left;"> The being of my future self is a person who is what myself wants me in the future <br>
        to be like, which is <span id="theinspiration">Jesus because he is <br>
        loving and powerful and loving</span>. The future self is loving, compassionate, merciful, lenient, <br>

        he focuses on prayer and the bible <br>
        he is clothed with humility, loves mercy, and acts justly <br>
        he is forgiving and inside has a loving heart. <br>
